Translated by Deepseek:

Modified the visual effects of melee weapons, adding customizable light effects that can be adjusted in the settings.

In server settings, administrators can choose to disable these modifications or enable actual effect changes.

Added weapon back display in the world or character selection interface.

Additional light effects for items in the backpack or dropped in the world can be enabled.

Redesigned the rendering of some projectiles and reworked the teleportation effect.

The visual effect configuration for melee weapons includes:

Textures, duration, particle count, color schemes, and special effects.

Actual effect changes must be enabled to apply the corresponding modification sequences.

Default key "Y" opens the sequence editing panel.

Sequences marked as "LogSpiralLibrary" or "CoolerItemVisualEffect" can be selected in the mod configuration's sequence selection.

Configuration Manager and Group Manager can be created.

Configuration Manager: Left-click to save the current configuration; right-click to open the panel, where you can rename, edit, or load saved configurations.

Group Manager: Right-click to open the panel and create a new group.

It is recommended to use a whitelist + non-default group approach to add modified items.

In the backpack, point the weapon at the item list box to add or replace it; click with an empty mouse slot to remove an item.

Group-bound configurations are those saved in the Configuration Manager. If no configuration is bound, the current mod configuration will be used instead of the saved one.
